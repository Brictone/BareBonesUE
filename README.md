# BareBonesUE
Just the Bare Bones for an Unreal Engine project.  Includes Pawn, and player controller, simple environement and light.  Lets see how small UE can get.

Originally used the compiled version of Unreal 5.4 from Github.  You can just switch to UE 5.4 from the Epic Launcher by right clicking on the uproject and selecting the version you want.
